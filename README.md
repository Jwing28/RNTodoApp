React Native Todo App

Hi! I created this app to become more familiar with React Native. 

Technologies - React native & Firebase & a library react-native-modal-dropdown & react-navigation

9/14/17
Currently, this app has:
  authentication 
  user can create, update, and delete items in their to do list
  
Would you like to try out this app?
  Make a local copy of this in your system.
  
  Terminal:
    -npm install
    -react-native run-ios. 
  
***The firebase config has been gitignored. You'll need to ask me for this information to load this app in simulator***    
***I have a mac and build this as an ios app.***
