# RNTodoApp
React Native Todo App

Hi! I created this app to become more familiar with React Native. 

Technologies - React native & Firebase & a library react-native-modal-dropdown & react-navigation

9/14/17
Currently, this app has:
  authentication 
  user can create, update, and delete items in their to do list
  
Would you like to try out this app?
  Make a local copy of this in your system.
  In the terminal, run react-native run-ios. This will load react packager and the ios simulator. You should see a todo app in 
    your iphone simulator. Click on the app to load it. You're all set!
    
***I have a mac and build this as an ios app.***
